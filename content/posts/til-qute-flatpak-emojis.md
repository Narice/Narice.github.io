For me the Flatpak version of `qutebrowser` doesn't display colored emojis. <br />
It displays black &amp; white emojis, but none in color :thinking:. <br />
Anyway, I thought I'd share this in case someone stumbles upon the same issue. <br />
My solution for now was to switch back to the non-flatpak version unfortunately :confused:.

Here is the [github issue](https://github.com/flathub/org.qutebrowser.qutebrowser/issues/263) where I've posted this problem and some pics:
